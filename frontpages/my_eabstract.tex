This paper develops a tensor-based 3D face reconstruction approach from a single color image. Instead of the grayscale image, we also consider additional color factors in constructing the tensor model. Canonical correlation analysis is applied to establish the relationship between the color image and the depth information in the face database. During the face reconstruction, given a single color face image, the depth estimation is computed from the CCA-based mapping between the tensor models. Experimental results show our approach is better suited under different lighting conditions and poses.
