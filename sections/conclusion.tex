%\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sum}

We proposed a 3D face reconstruction approach with a
color image in this paper. Compared with methods considering
grayscale images, the proposed approach uses multiple image
factors including the color information in establishing tensor
models with respect to images and corresponding depths.
A CCA-based mapping between image and depth tensors
is built, which bonds crucial information that benefits the
reconstruction. Once the mapping is constructed, 3D faces can
be reconstructed from a single color image with the help of
tensor models. The proposed approach also works when the
input face image is captured under different lighting conditions and poses. Experiment results show that the proposed method produces better outcome due to the inclusion of color channels in the multi-factor consideration.
